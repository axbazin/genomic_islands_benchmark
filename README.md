# genomic_islands_benchmark

Final formated versions of each tool's genomic island predictions.

Most of those have been parsed to a 4 column tsv format as follow :
- Accession_number : Indicates the contig ID (NC_XXX)
- Start : The start position  of the genomic island
- End : The end (or stop) position of the genomic island
- Prediction_method : The software, or method, used to predict this genomic island

Some were downloaded from [islandviewer website](http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer/download/), if you are looking for up-to-date data from their tools you should download it from there.

PredictBias predictions were downloaded from [PredictBias website](

All others were run on genome versions indicated in 'Strains_RefSeqID.tsv'
